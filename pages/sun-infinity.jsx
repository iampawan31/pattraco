      "We manifest the infinite power of the sun in the form of renewable energy. Pattraco's solar endeavour - SUN INFINITY, is one of the largest solar power manufacturers in India. With our projects in north-western Rajasthan, India we supply renewable energy to central and state government utilities and independent industrial and commercial customers at predictable fixed prices. Since our renewable power generation does not rely on fossil fuels, our electricity prices are insulated from the volatility of input commodity pricing. We also provide delivery commitments for the electricity production of our power plants to our customers.",

    content:
      'We have lowered our cost of renewable power generation through value engineering, operational performance monitoring and strong financial strengths. This allows us to deliver cost-effective energy for our customers. Our in-house EPC expertise lowers system costs and our advanced in-house operations and maintenance capability allows us to increase power yields and monitor project performance near real-time. Coupled with our strong financial strategy, we believe that we are able to offer low-cost renewable power solutions at high efficiency yields.',

As a result we are able to build long-term community relationships, which allows us to improve our completion time, further reducing project development risk.',
